#A quick introduction to version control with Git and GitHub

##Synopsis and Motivation

This is the repository for the paper "A quick introduction to version control with Git and GitHub".
The goal of this paper was to introduce scientists to the concepts behind version control (using Git) so that they can incorporate these practices into their workflows.
The [manuscript](https://www.authorea.com/users/5990/articles/17489/_show_article) was written using the [Authorea](http://www.Authorea.com) platform.

In the manuscript, we encourage readers to try out contributing to repositories on GitHub by contributing to this repository by forking the repository, `git clone` their fork locally, adding a file called {GitHub_username}.txt to the `readers` folder, `git add` + `commit`, `git push` their commits to their GitHub accounts, and issuing a Pull Request (PR) to incorporate those changes into this repository.
Take a look in the [readers](readers) folder to see all of the contributions from anyone who has had a Pull Request accepted.
If you haven't contributed already, we'd love to see your PR!
