\textbf{Outline}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Introduction to version control
  \begin{itemize}
    \item What is the problem?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Filesystem full of analysis\_01, analysis\_02, analysis\_03\_final, etc.
      \item Collaborating via email. How to merge the changes made by different authors?
    \end{itemize}
    \item What is the solution? Explain basic idea of version control software
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Able to revert to past versions.
      \item Able to merge changes made asynchronously by multiple collaborators.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Why is it so powerful? Increased reproducibility and collaboration, not only for code but also manuscripts \cite{23448176}
\end{itemize}
  \item Using version control to track your code (as a single contributor)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item How to set up a repository
    \item How to tell version control what to commit
    \item How to commit new material and changes
    \item How to revert to previous versions
    \item \textbf{Figure 1} - Diagram "git add" and "git commit" steps
  \end{itemize}
  \item Using version control online (trying to avoid using jargon like "remote", which I realize I have jargon all over the place other than this one line, but we should think of how we should present the jargon to a biology audience probably)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item How to set up and link a remote repository to local repository
    \item Sync local and online versions of repositories
    \item \textbf{Figure 2} - Diagram "git push" and "git pull" steps with a remote repository
  \end{itemize}
  \item Using version control with collaborators
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Fork a repository
      \item Submit a pull request
      \item Fix merge conflicts
      \item \textbf{Figure 3} - Diagram collaboration using fork and pull request
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}



\textbf{Potential box (or table) ideas:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Vocabulary: define things like commit, merge, branch, repo, etc...
  \item Other version control systems and hosting sites
  \item Branches (briefly introduce concept)
\end{enumerate}
