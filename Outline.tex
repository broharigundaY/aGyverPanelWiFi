\textbf{Outline}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Introduction to version control (what is it, what are the different flavors, maybe a history lesson?, who else uses it?)
  \item Using version control to track your code (as a single contributor)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item How to set up a repository
    \item How to tell version control what to commit
    \item How to commit new material and changes
    \item How to revert to previous versions
  \end{itemize}
  \item Using version control online (trying to avoid using jargon like "remote", which I realize I have jargon all over the place other than this one line, but we should think of how we should present the jargon to a biology audience probably)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item How to set up and link a remote repository to local repository
    \item Sync local and online versions of repositories
  \end{itemize}
  \item Using version control with collaborators
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Copying a repository remotely
      \item Merging
  \end{itemize}
  \item Why use version control as a scientist?
\end{enumerate}



\textbf{Potential box ideas:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Vocabulary: define things like commit, merge, branch, repo, etc...
  \item Why use version control?
  \item Why stage and then commit?
  \item Commit early and often
  \item Why branch?
  \item What not to version control.
\end{enumerate}
