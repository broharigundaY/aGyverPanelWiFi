To start versioning your code with Git, navigate to your newly created or existing project directory. Start tracking your code by running the command \verb|git init|, which \textit{init}iates a new Git repository. Next you'll need to give Git some information about yourself, since it records who makes each change to the file(s). Provide your name and email by running the following lines \verb|git config --global user.name "First Last"| and \verb|git config --global user.email "user@domain"|, respectively. Now you're ready to start tracking your code.
