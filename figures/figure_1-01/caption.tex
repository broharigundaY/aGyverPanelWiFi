\textbf{Figure 1. The git add/commit process.} To store a snapshot of changes in your repository, first "git add" any files to the staging area you wish to commit (for example, you've updated the "process.sh" file). Second, type "git commit" with a message. Only files added to the staging area will be committed. All past commits are located in the hidden ".git" directory in your repository.
