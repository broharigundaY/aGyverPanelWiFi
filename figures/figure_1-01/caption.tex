\textbf{Figure 1. The git add/commit process.} To store a snapshot of changes to a file in your repository, first git add any files to the staging area you wish to commit (for example, you've updated the process.sh file). To take a snapshot of those changes, type git commit with a message. Only files added to the staging area will be committed. All past commits are located in the hidden .git directory in your repository.
