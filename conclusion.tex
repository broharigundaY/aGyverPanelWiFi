\subsection{Conclusion}

Git is a powerful, albeit complicated at first, tool that can improve code development.
Furthermore, it does not need to be learned in its entirety to be useful.
Instead, you can derive tangible benefits from adopting version control in stages.
With a few commands (\verb|git init|, \verb|git add|, \verb|git commit|), you can start tracking your code development and avoid a filesystem full of copied files.
Adding a few additional commands (\verb|git push|, \verb|git clone|, \verb|git pull|) and a GitHub account, you can share your code online, sync your changes across machines, and collaborate in small groups.
Lastly, by forking public repositories and sending pull requests, you can directly improve scientific software.
